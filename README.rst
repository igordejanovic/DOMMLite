DOMMLite
========

DOMMLite is a DSL for defining static structure of business applications. It is an ER-like language with some usefull extensions. From DOMMLite models a program code of fully working CRUD(Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) applications can be generated. Currently, generator is built for `Django web framework`_.

It is implemented in `xText` during 2007-2009. Back then xText was a part of the openArchitectureware framework.
DOMMLite is not maintained/updated since then and I am making it available as a FLOSS software in case someone find it usefull.

Full description of the DOMMLite language and tools is decribed in this paper:
`A domain-specific language for defining static structure of database applications`_
